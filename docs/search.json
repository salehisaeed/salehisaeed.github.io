    "text": "Robust and efficient flow control\nA major line of work is Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for active flow control. DRL promises sophisticated control strategies beyond classical methods, but current DRL‚ÄìCFD frameworks struggle with efficiency, robustness, and generalization. My approach combines multifidelity learning, transfer learning, and robust learning under uncertainty to push DRL toward realistic high-Reynolds-number flows and deliver controllers that transfer across operating conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Overview of multifidelity DRL pipeline"

During my postdoc at Chalmers, I created semi-implicit mesh-deformation techniques in OpenFOAM to enable simulating complex mesh motion of hydraulic turbines during transient operation. These simulations provide the detailed data needed for validation, reduced-order modeling, and data-driven analysis. :contentReferenceoaicite:2\n\nSuggested figures:\n‚Ä¢ DES of the Timi»ôoara swirl generator (vortex rope visualisation)\n‚Ä¢ Francis-99 shutdown vortical structures / stagnant regions (blue‚Äìred isosurface)\n‚Ä¢ Link to startup video of Francis-99"

These methods extract coherent structures from large datasets and yield low-dimensional models for prediction and control; I have applied them to hydropower turbines and transient operating conditions. :contentReferenceoaicite:3\n\nSuggested media: short DMD/POD animation or mode visualisation."
