I study complex fluid flows using high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). My research combines data-driven approaches and machine learning with CFD to develop efficient and reliable tools for simulation, model order reduction, control, and uncertainty quantification.\n\nI am first and foremost a CFD specialist. To me, CFD is more than a black box, and I am particularly engaged in open-source development, especially with OpenFOAM. Additinally, I am also passionate about data-driven modeling, and how it can be combined with CFD. My doctoral research focused on uncertainty quantification of turbulent flows in turbomachinery, where I developed sparse and efficient methods to assess operational and geometrical uncertainties and applied robust optimization under uncertainty. During my postdoc at Chalmers University of Technology, I developed numerical methods, in OpenFOAM, for transient simulations of hydraulic turbines and expanded into reduced-order modeling, studying approaches such as POD, SPOD, DMD, and sparsity-promoting DMD.\n\nMore recently, my research has focused on integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with CFD. I have investigated flow control using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in OpenFOAM and developed multi-fidelity physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving PDEs. This line of work places my research at the intersection of high-fidelity CFD and data-driven methods, with the aim of creating efficient, robust, and trustworthy approaches for the simulation, analysis, and control of complex flows.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n---\n\n<!--\n### Quick links\n- Email `saeed.salehi@liu.se`\n- LiU profile (EN) · LiU-profil (SV)\n- Google Scholar · ORCID · GitHub\n-->\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Saeed Salehi\n**Associate Professor of Fluid Mechanics**  \nDivision of Applied Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics  \nDepartment of Management and Engineering  \nLinköping University  \n\n<!--\n_Data-driven and AI methods for high-fidelity CFD_\n-->\n\n---\n\n## Background\n\n::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"28%\"}\n![](img/saeed2.jpg){width=85% fig-align=\"left\"}\n<div class=\"icon-row\">\n  <a href=\"https://liu.se/en/employee/saesa86\" class=\"iconbtn\" aria-label=\"LiU Profile\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-university\"></i></a>\n  <a href=\"mailto:saeed.salehi@liu.se\" class=\"iconbtn\" aria-label=\"Email\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-envelope\"></i></a>\n  <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=6bn6bn0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate\" class=\"iconbtn\" aria-label=\"Google Scholar\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-graduation-cap\"></i></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saeed-Salehi-3?ev=hdr_xprf\" class=\"iconbtn\" aria-label=\"ResearchGate\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-researchgate\"></i></a>\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/salehisaeed\" class=\"iconbtn\" aria-label=\"GitHub\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-github\"></i></a>\n  <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/saeed-salehi-3b97685a/\" class=\"iconbtn\" aria-label=\"LinkedIn\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-linkedin\"></i></a>\n  <!-- Optional:\n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USERNAME\" class=\"iconbtn\" aria-label=\"X/Twitter\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-x-twitter\"></i></a>\n  -->\n</div>\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"72%\"}\n\nI am Associate Professor of Fluid Mechanics at Linköping University.
