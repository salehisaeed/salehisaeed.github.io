title: "Opportunities"
---

I enjoy working with motivated students and researchers who are interested in **computational fluid dynamics**, **high-fidelity simulations**, and **data-driven methods**.

# MSc and BSc Thesis Projects

I supervise thesis projects in areas such as:  
- Development of CFD methods in OpenFOAM  
- High-fidelity simulations of turbulent and unsteady flows  
- Data-driven and machine learning methods for flow analysis and control  

If you are studying at LinkÃ¶ping University and would like to align your thesis with my research, feel free to reach out.

# PhD and Postdoc Opportunities

At the moment there are **no funded PhD or Postdoc openings** in the group.  
When positions become available, they will be announced here as well as on the Universityâ€™s website.  

If you have your own funding or plan to apply for scholarships, I am open to discussing possible projects.

# Information for Prospective PhDs and Postdocs

I am always open to discussing possibilities with motivated PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers.  
Even if there are no funded positions available at the moment, I am glad to support applications for external scholarships and fellowships and can host you at LinkÃ¶ping University.  

## Examples of funding opportunities for PhD candidates
- Swedish national graduate schools (e.g. WASP)  
- Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Doctoral Networks  
- Other national or EU-based PhD scholarship programs  

## Examples of funding opportunities for postdoctoral researchers
- Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation postdoc grants  
- Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships  
- National mobility or international exchange programs  

## How to Get in Touch
If you are interested in joining, please send me:  
1. A short CV  
2. A brief description of your research interests and how they connect to my research  
3. Information about your background in CFD, programming, and machine learning  
4. (If relevant) A detailed plan for applying for a scholarship or external funding
